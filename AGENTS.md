# Contributor instructions

## Workspace

Use pnpm and the Node version declared in package.json. Shared TypeScript, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Vitest, Lefthook and commitlint configuration lives at the workspace root. Run workspace commands there. React Router application source is apps/web/src/app, imported with `~/`; native Node entry/config files and public assets remain at the app root.

Before changing Router routes, loaders, actions or integration, read `.agents/skills/react-router/SKILL.md`, its framework-mode reference and the matching installed Router documentation.

## Checks and tests

After changes run `pnpm lint:fix`, then `pnpm fmt`. Before completion run `pnpm exec oxlint --deny-warnings --format=agent`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` (use `pnpm exec vitest run` for a finite run).

Unit tests use Vitest and Testing Library, colocated as *.test.ts(x). Each package has a Vitest project. Use createRoutesStub when components need Router context; invoke loaders/actions directly. Keep environment examples synchronized with new variables, document purpose/defaults and never commit .env files.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits, checked by @commitlint/config-conventional. Lefthook runs Oxlint/Oxfmt on staged files. Do not bypass hooks with --no-verify.

## Rendering

SSR is the default; SSR=false at dev/build selects SPA.

SPA builds reject non-root server loaders, server actions/middleware/headers and non-root HydrateFallback. The root loader runs at build time. Components, meta, links, ErrorBoundary and client data APIs can support both modes. Select rendering requirements deliberately rather than assuming every application can switch unchanged.

## Application infrastructure

Compose global providers in AppRoot. Components read useAppEnvironment from ~/providers/environment; never infer host identity from user agents, query parameters or data-shell. Do not call the bridge during rendering. Root loader data seeds hydration; confirmed preload identity survives revalidation.

Pages compose BasicShell or NavigationShell with ModuleLayout. Modules do not handle OS branches, native control geometry or window IPC. Mark top interactive elements with getInteractiveProps and drag regions with getDragRegionProps. Inline CHROME_SAFETY_CSS and retain .root-chrome-fallback outside route children for normal, fallback and error documents. Safety geometry cannot depend on provider/bootstrap readiness.

@repo/shared must remain browser-importable with no node: imports or runtime dependencies. Resolve source through @repo/source in workspace Vite, Vitest and TypeScript configuration; new consumers need the same condition.
