# Contributor instructions

## Workspace

Use pnpm and the Node version declared in package.json. Shared TypeScript, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Vitest, Lefthook and commitlint configuration lives at the workspace root. Run workspace commands there. React Router application source is apps/web/src/app, imported with `~/`; native Node entry/config files and public assets remain at the app root.

Before changing Router routes, loaders, actions or integration, read `.agents/skills/react-router/SKILL.md`, its framework-mode reference and the matching installed Router documentation.

## Checks and tests

After changes run `pnpm lint:fix`, then `pnpm fmt`. Before completion run `pnpm exec oxlint --deny-warnings --format=agent`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` (use `pnpm exec vitest run` for a finite run).

Unit tests use Vitest and Testing Library, colocated as *.test.ts(x). Each package has a Vitest project. Use createRoutesStub when components need Router context; invoke loaders/actions directly. Keep environment examples synchronized with new variables, document purpose/defaults and never commit .env files.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits, checked by @commitlint/config-conventional. Lefthook runs Oxlint/Oxfmt on staged files. Do not bypass hooks with --no-verify.

## Rendering

SSR is the default; SSR=false at dev/build selects SPA.

SPA builds reject non-root server loaders, server actions/middleware/headers and non-root HydrateFallback. The root loader runs at build time. Components, meta, links, ErrorBoundary and client data APIs can support both modes. Select rendering requirements deliberately rather than assuming every application can switch unchanged.

## Server and host

packages/server is Hono, independently runnable under native Node and also hosted in-process. Use explicit .ts relative imports and erasable TypeScript; no enums, namespaces, parameter properties, import.meta.env or React Router dependency. Development-only behavior checks NODE_ENV === "development"; unset means production.

Keep host logic in apps/web/src/host. app.ts composes createServerApp with Router; web-app.ts adds static/SPA handling as createWebApp. server.ts only loads environment/build and starts production. getHostApp serves dev/prerender through the Vite adapter. Load .env only in react-router.config.ts and server.ts. Preserve dotenv 17.x/dotenv-expand 13.x; command substitution in newer expand versions needs review.

Keep source/dist export targets synchronized. Workspace imports use @repo/source. All packages use the same Hono version. API route chains live in packages/server/src/routes and mount under /api; unknown API routes return JSON 404. Browser/app imports from server are type-only via @repo/server/types; host/tests may import implementations.

Loaders/actions call context.get(apiContext) in-process; browser/client loaders use ~/lib/api. In-process calls forward request credentials, ID and cancellation, bypassing API CSRF. Put mutations in actions, never loaders; Router performs action origin checks. Native clients send JSON or matching Origin. Only trust forwarded headers behind a trusted proxy.

Pass request.signal to upstream fetch. Use createTestContext or a fake apiContext for loader tests and Hono testClient for API routes. Wrap deferred promises in logRejection with the request logger and signal; Router handleError does not capture these rejections. Hono stream/streamText/streamSSE callbacks use rethrowNonErrors and logStreamFailure. Log structured data first through c.var.logger or loggerContext, never console, credentials or full query strings.

Middleware extends the same host/server chain before Router fallback; do not wrap it in a second Hono app. Keep entry.server.tsx aligned with Router's default Node entry during upgrades. CSP uses one SSR document nonce for ServerRouter, React, Links, ScrollRestoration and Scripts; preserve it across revalidation. Static HTML uses sha256 hashes. Production script-src excludes unsafe-inline; configure additional resource origins explicitly.

In-process server data APIs provide SSR data and cookie forwarding but prevent SPA builds. Client data APIs support either build mode with a first-render skeleton and a browser request. Moving SSR server-data routes to SPA requires rewriting them.
